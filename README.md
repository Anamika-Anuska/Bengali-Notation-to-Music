# Bengali-Notation-to-Music
In this project we have tried to generate audio from an image of the notation of a song. We used bengali song notations (Swaralipi) for this project.
The final product of this project is a GUI where you can upload a scanned image of the notations and that particular song will be played as an output.
We have used Matlab for this project.
